                We were challenged to create an original app design that solves for an everyday problem. Immediately, our minds went to helping people in the kitchen. To determine that were was a need for such an app and to solidify our direction, we set up 12 user interviews to ask about their hopes, goals, and struggles in the kitchen.

                Through our user research we found that most of our users are everyday home chefs, juggling busy schedules but committed to serving up wholesome, budget-friendly meals for themselves and their families. Their kitchen woes revolve around common frustrations: overcooking or under-cooking dishes, dealing with food waste, and the overall hassle it can cause
                <p>We believe that users should have the confidence that their meals will turn out perfectly on the first try. Recognizing that not everyone has the time or resources to risk preparing food improperly, especially when their culinary skills are still developing, we propose the development of an app.We recognize that several factors effect the outcome of a meal like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Altitude</li>
                    <li>Appliance used</li>
                    <li>Type of pot, pan, or dish used</li> 
                    <li>Amount of food</li>
                    <li>Type of fat used</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our app would gather all of this information to provide foolproof and personalized instructions; assisting people in preparing their meals flawlessly.</p>

                Following usability testing of our initial app version, we received a significant piece of feedback: the micro copy was too formal and serious for users' tastes. They were seeking a more relaxed and friendly tone that better aligns with the joyful nature of cooking. In response, we iterated to infuse the app with a more casual and playful language to enhance the user experience

                    After two rounds of usability testing and iterative design improvements, we successfully crafted Perfect Plateâ€”an app that addresses user pain points and delivers a seamless experience. Perfect Plate empowers users to save time, reduce food waste, and enhance their culinary skills.User feedback strongly validates the utility of Perfect Plate in the kitchen, solidifying its place as a valuable tool. Moving forward, we aspire to refine the app further with additional features based on user input, including a multi-dish timer for real-world cooking scenarios and a baking-oriented version to provide precise guidance in the art of baking.
